# Salient Target Based Dual Attention Network with Self-Adaptive Learning for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion
This is the implementation for "Dual Attention-Based Network with Self-Adaptive Learning for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion".

### Contributions

- The proposed dual attention strategy can obtain effective visible and infrared features to intensify the fusion of  favorable features, by adopting global attention machanism. 
-  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce contrastive learning to image fusion. By utilizing  the mask-based contrastive guidance, the fused image can make use of both rich details from visible images and bright target information from infrared images, thus rendering superior saliency with vivid texture details.
- To guide the optimization of our network, a self-adaptive loss is devised, which automatically adapts to the characteristics of source  images in the training phase.
